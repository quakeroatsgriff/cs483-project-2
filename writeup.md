The site is organized to meet SEO and accessibility standards by following best
practices in its structure and code.

For SEO, the `meta` and `title` tags are used to improve search
engine discoverability and ranking.

For accessibility, the site incorporates semantic HTML
elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`, which provide
a logical structure for screen readers. The navigation menu uses the `role="navigation"`
attribute. Input fields in the form are labeled explicitly with `<label>` elements,
ensuring users with screen readers can associate labels with their respective inputs. The `required` attribute
ensures essential fields are completed, and proper input types (e.g., `text`, `email`)
are used for accurate data entry. Also, alternative text is provided for
the video in case it cannot be played.
